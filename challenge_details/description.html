<p>This challenge comes from the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14694">Towards Realistic Single-Task Continuous Learning Research for NER</a>. The paper presents a method of splitting the <a href="https://github.com/jeniyat/StackOverflowNER">StackOverflowNER dataset</a> into 5 train/test episodes to create a more realistic and challenging continual learning setting.</p>

<p>This challenge involves the "skewed" episodes from the paper. You should train a model on each of the 5 training episodes in succession, without revisiting prior episodes. You may employ any continual learning strategy you wish (including replay of small amounts of data from previous episodes). You must evaluate the final model (trained on all 5 episodes) on all 5 test episodes. You will upload a submission file in json format containing your predicted tags for each example in each episode. These predictions will be evaluated against the ground truth tags.</p>
