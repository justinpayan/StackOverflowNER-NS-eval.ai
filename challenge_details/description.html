<p>This challenge comes from the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14694">Towards Realistic Single-Task Continuous Learning Research for NER</a>. The paper presents a method of splitting the <a href="https://github.com/jeniyat/StackOverflowNER">StackOverflowNER dataset</a> into 5 train/test episodes to create a more realistic and challenging continual learning setting.</p>

<p>This challenge involves the "skewed" episodes from the paper. You should submit code to train a model on each of the 5 training episodes in succession, without revisiting prior episodes. The final model will be evaluated on all 5 test episodes, and the average F1 score over all 5 test episodes will be reported.</p>
